# Running Oh My T3Code in the background

On Linux and macOS, T3 Code can run as a service for your user so you do not need
to keep a terminal open.

## Manage the service

Install the `oh-my-t3code` CLI first ([Install Oh My T3Code](./install.md#cli)), then
run these commands on the machine that will host T3 Code:

| Task                            | Command                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Install and start               | `oh-my-t3code service install`   |
| Inspect status and log location | `oh-my-t3code service status`    |
| Update to the newest release    | `oh-my-t3code update`            |
| Repair the installed service    | `oh-my-t3code service install`   |
| Stop and remove from startup    | `oh-my-t3code service uninstall` |

Uninstalling the service leaves your projects, threads, and settings intact.
Running `oh-my-t3code service install` again repairs a service that `oh-my-t3code service status`
reports as broken.

Install uses the current CLI version. Use `oh-my-t3code update --channel nightly` to move to the
nightly train. An older CLI refuses to replace a newer service unless you explicitly add
`--allow-downgrade`.

Updating restarts the server. Finish active work first, and wait for any remote
update already in progress. To match a remote client's version, follow
[Updating T3 Code](./updating.md).

Pass an exact version (`oh-my-t3code update 0.0.42`) to pin one, `--channel nightly` to
switch trains, or `--allow-downgrade` to move backwards. `preview` is a
maintainers' test train: its builds can be broken and are never offered as
updates, so the installer and `oh-my-t3code update` ask for confirmation before
installing one.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nguyenphutrong/oh-my-t3code/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, run
`irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nguyenphutrong/oh-my-t3code/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex` in
PowerShell instead. Windows background services are not supported.

It places `oh-my-t3code` in `~/.local/bin` and reuses the same download when you later
run `oh-my-t3code service install`. It follows the stable train by default; set
`T3CODE_CHANNEL=nightly` for nightlies, `T3CODE_VERSION` to pin an exact
version, or `T3CODE_RELEASE_BASE_URL` to download from a mirror.

`preview` is a third train that maintainers cut from unreleased branches to
exercise the release pipeline. Those builds can be broken, receive no fixes,
and are never offered as updates; the installer and `oh-my-t3code update` only take you
there when you ask for the channel explicitly, and warn you when they do.

Once installed, `oh-my-t3code update` moves the machine to a
newer one without npm: it downloads the newest release on the channel the
running executable came from, verifies it, and points the launcher at it. When
a background service is installed for the same T3 home it asks before
restarting it, since a restart interrupts running agent turns, terminals, and
remote clients; answer no and the service keeps the old version until you run
`oh-my-t3code service update`. From a script there is no prompt, so pass `--yes` to
restart the service. A server you started by hand is never touched; the
command tells you it is still on the old version so you can restart it
yourself. Pass an exact version (`oh-my-t3code update 0.0.41-preview.20260912.1595`) to
pin one, `--channel` to follow a different release train (moving onto preview from stable or nightly asks for confirmation), or
`--allow-downgrade` to move backwards.

`oh-my-t3code uninstall` reverses the install script: it shows what it found (the
background service, the launcher, every downloaded version under
`~/.oh-my-t3code/runtime`), asks once, and removes them. Your projects, threads, and
settings under `~/.oh-my-t3code/userdata` are kept; delete that directory yourself if
you want them gone too. Pass `--yes` from a script.

## Platform support

Linux needs systemd user services. Setup enables lingering so T3 Code starts at
boot and keeps running after logout. If this needs administrator permission,
setup prints a recovery command before changing the service.

macOS starts the service when you log in and stops it when you log out. Keep the
Mac logged in and awake for unattended remote access. Installing over SSH while
nobody is logged in at the Mac's screen can fail at the final start step; the
service is still installed and will start at the next login.

Windows background services are not supported.

T3 Connect can offer service installation during setup, but the two are managed
separately. Signing out of T3 Connect does not stop or uninstall the service.

## Troubleshooting

Start with `oh-my-t3code service status` on the host. It prints the log path and, on Linux,
checks whether the installed service is running, enabled, and allowed to survive
logout.

If it stops when your SSH session closes, check for `linger-disabled`. An
administrator can enable lingering with:

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"
```

Over SSH, allow sudo to prompt:

```sh
ssh -t your-server 'sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"'
```

Then retry service setup as your normal user. Run only the `loginctl` command
with sudo; running T3 Code as root creates a separate installation and Connect
identity. Without administrator access, run `oh-my-t3code serve` in a terminal and keep
that session open.

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `linger-unavailable`                    | Run `loginctl show-user "$(id -un)" --property=Linger` and check that systemd-logind is available.                             |
| `user-manager-unavailable`              | Run `systemctl --user status` in a login session for the service user; check your distribution's systemd user-session support. |
| `service-disabled` or `service-stopped` | Read the log and `systemctl --user status oh-my-t3code.service`, then use the repair command printed by Oh My T3Code.          |
| `restart-pending`                       | A newer version is installed but the service still runs the previous one. Run `oh-my-t3code service restart`.                  |

On macOS, check **System Settings → General → Login Items** if the service no
longer starts at login. If agent work cannot access Desktop, Documents, or
Downloads, it may need Full Disk Access for the `oh-my-t3code` executable listed in
`ProgramArguments` in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/app.bytrong.ohmyt3code.service.plist`.
